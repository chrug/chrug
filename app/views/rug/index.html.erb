    RailsConf2012 was exciting, there was a lot of talk of the growing
    community and how to teach others ruby and rails.  In the midst of all
    the excitment @tenderlove (Aaron Patterson) was promoted from "Se√±or
    Software Engineer" to the title of "Corey Haines".  In desperate times
    desperate actions must be taken.  Chrug is an attempt at promoting
    everyone to "Corey Haines".
