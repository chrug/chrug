### Corey Haines Ruby User Group

RailsConf2012 was exciting, there was a lot of talk of the growing
community and how to teach others ruby and rails.  In the midst of all
the excitment @tenderlove (Aaron Patterson) was promoted from "Senor
Software Engineer" to the title of "Corey Haines".  In desperate times
desperate actions must be taken.  Chrug is an attempt at promoting
everyone to "Corey Haines".
